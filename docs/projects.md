# My own project

Within this course each of you or a group of you will work on a project of your own. The project should be a real-world problem that you choose either from your field or wherever you want. The project should be a Python project and apply the concepts we have done so far. The goal is to transfer the knowledge you have gained in this course and gain confidence in Python programming.

There will be two projects in total. In the first project you will try to solve a problem in a procedural way. In the second project you will try to solve the same problem in an object-oriented way. The goal is to understand the difference between procedural and object-oriented programming and to learn when to use which.

In each project phase, you will present your project and we will discuss the code and the solution. You will also get feedback on your code and your solution.

## How can I approach the project?

There are numerous ways to approach a project. Here are some steps that you can follow:

1. **Understand the problem**: The first step is to understand the problem you are trying to solve. What is the problem? What are the inputs? What are the outputs? What are the constraints?

2. **Design the solution**: The next step is to design a solution to the problem. How can you solve the problem? What are the steps you need to take? What are the functions you need to write?

3. **Implement the solution**: The next step is to implement the solution in Python. Write the code that solves the problem.

4. **Test the solution**: The final step is to test the solution. Does the code work as expected? Does it solve the problem?

## Which tools can I use?

Besides Jupyter notebooks (Google Colab), you can use any tool you like to work on your project. You can use an IDE like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), or any other IDE. IDEs are especially useful if you want to work on larger projects and re-use certain parts of your code.

You can also use version control tools like [Git](https://git-scm.com) and platforms like [GitHub](https://github.com) to manage your code and collaborate with others.

## How can I present my project?

Preferably you should present the implementation of your project and an example that uses your implementation. You can use Jupyter notebooks to present your project. You can also use slides or any other tool you like.
